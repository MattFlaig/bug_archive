== BugArchive

Rails CRUD app to archive bugs, solutions and explanations with code snippet upload, search and authentication. 
The focus is on learning and understanding why a certain bug appeared, not just mentioning the solution.

Some planned features to extend the basic functionality:
* Dictionary of concepts
* Tagging bugs and solutions with concepts
* Displaying explanations dynamically with JQuery
* Discussion / chat forum
* StackOverflow API
